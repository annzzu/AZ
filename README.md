#### Problem

** Due to the on-going COVID situation countries have implemented travel restrictions,
which differ based on traveler and origin countries. This makes it hard for the traveller 
to understand which regulations are affecting their travel plans **

#### Goal

** A mobile application where users can quickly and efficiently check documentation
against travel restrictions imposed on the passenger by the authorities in the transit or
destination country. App crosschecks documentation against travel restrictions
imposed on the passenger by the authorities in the transit or destination country. Consequent
to inputing relevant travel information, app shall return the specific set of regulations, for
designated destination for the relevant users. **

### The application scope satisfies the following user stories:
